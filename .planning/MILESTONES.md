# Project Milestones: PROACTIVE AI Constitution Toolkit

## v1.0 Pipeline B MVP (Shipped: 2026-01-23)

**Delivered:** Working W&B Trace Adapter with pilot validation evidence, CI Safety Gate core implementation, and complete project infrastructure for neurodivergent-first execution.

**Phases completed:** P0 (9 tasks), A01 (6 tasks), A02 partial (4/6 tasks)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Functional W&B Trace Adapter converting PROACTIVE logs to auditable tables
- 52% reduction in root cause attribution time demonstrated (pilot study)
- CI Safety Gate validator detecting I1-I6 constitutional violations
- Safety Case skeleton with integrated evidence (E-O1)
- Complete neurodivergent-first execution infrastructure

**Stats:**

- 53 files created/modified
- ~18,700 lines of code (Python, Markdown, JSON, YAML)
- 19 tasks completed across 3 phases
- 5 days from initial commit to ship

**Git range:** `a7a67bd` (Initial commit) → `1e91b29` (Session 11)

**Tech debt accepted:**
- A02-T5/T6 deferred (CI validation study)
- GitHub Actions workflow not yet enforcing CI Safety Gate
- Single evaluator bias in A01 validation

**What's next:** v1.1 will complete CI Safety Gate validation, wire GitHub Actions workflow, and begin HELM Safety Profile (A03).
