# 06_DATA_QUALITY

## Status: ⚠️ TO CREATE

This directory will contain Stage 5 artifacts for publication-grade evidence.

## Planned Documents

| Document | Purpose | Priority |
|----------|---------|----------|
| DATASET_CARDS.md | Provenance, composition, limitations for each dataset | P2 |
| ANNOTATION_GUIDELINES.md | Labeling taxonomy, edge case decision rules | P2 |
| INTER_RATER_RELIABILITY_TEMPLATE.md | κ/ICC calculations, disagreement resolution | P2 |
| REPRODUCIBILITY_CHECKLIST.md | arXiv ML reproducibility checklist completion | P2 |

## Creation Criteria

These documents should be created when:
- Data collection begins
- Annotation protocols are needed
- Reproducibility documentation is required

## Specification: DATASET_CARDS.md

### Required Sections (per NeurIPS/arXiv standards)
- Dataset name and version
- Motivation and intended use
- Composition (size, splits, format)
- Collection process
- Preprocessing/cleaning steps
- Annotation process (if applicable)
- Uses and limitations
- Distribution and licensing
- Maintenance plan

## Specification: REPRODUCIBILITY_CHECKLIST.md

### arXiv ML Reproducibility Standards
- [ ] Model architecture fully specified
- [ ] Training procedure documented
- [ ] Hyperparameters reported
- [ ] Random seeds provided
- [ ] Compute requirements stated
- [ ] Evaluation metrics defined
- [ ] Statistical significance tests described
- [ ] Code/data availability stated
