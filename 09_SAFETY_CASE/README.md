# 09_SAFETY_CASE

## Status: IN DEVELOPMENT

This directory contains the safety case synthesis artifact—structured arguments linking PROACTIVE principles to evidence.

## Documents

| Document | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [SAFETY_CASE_SKELETON.md](SAFETY_CASE_SKELETON.md) | GSN structure with argument strands and evidence registry | ✅ Created |
| SAFETY_CASE_FULL.md | Complete claim→argument→evidence synthesis | 🔲 Pending |

## Current Evidence

| ID | Description | Source | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|--------|
| E-O1 | W&B Adapter pilot results | [Adapter 01](../ADAPTER_MODULES/01_WANDB_TRACE_ADAPTER/USE_CASE_EVIDENCE.md) | ✅ Complete (Pilot) |

## Planned Documents (Original)

## Creation Criteria

This document should be created when:
- All evaluation results are complete
- All failure modes are catalogued
- All mitigations are verified

## Specification: SAFETY_CASE_FULL.md

### Required Sections

#### 1. Executive Summary
- Top-level safety claim
- Evidence strength assessment
- Residual risk acknowledgment

#### 2. Claim Hierarchy
- G1: Top goal
- G1.n: Sub-goals
- S: Strategies linking goals
- E: Evidence items
- A: Assumptions
- C: Context

#### 3. Evidence Mapping

| Claim | Evidence | Source | Strength |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| G1.1 | Comparison results | 05_EVALUATION | Strong |
| G1.2 | Red team results | 05_EVALUATION | Medium |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

#### 4. Assumption Register

| ID | Assumption | Justification | Monitoring |
|----|------------|---------------|------------|
| A1 | Users act on outputs | Domain analysis | Usage telemetry |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

#### 5. Residual Risks

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Status |
|------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Novel attack vectors | High | Medium | Ongoing red-teaming |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

#### 6. Confidence Assessment

| Claim | Confidence | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| G1 | Medium-High | Strong quantitative evidence; some gaps in adversarial coverage |
| G1.1 | High | Multiple controlled studies, consistent results |
| G1.2 | Medium | Red team found no bypasses, but coverage incomplete |
| ... | ... | ... |

#### 7. Update Protocol
- When to revise safety case
- Evidence refresh schedule
- Assumption validation frequency

## Anthropic RSP Alignment

The safety case structure aligns with Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy by:

1. **Threat pathway coverage:** Misuse, accident, emergent autonomy addressed
2. **Capability-harm mapping:** F1-F5 taxonomy links capabilities to harms
3. **Control evaluation:** Gate architecture provides control mechanism
4. **Evidence standards:** Quantitative thresholds, statistical tests
5. **Uncertainty acknowledgment:** Residual risks explicitly stated
