# Researcher Positioning: Corey Alejandro

## Background (3 sentences max)

I'm a neurodivergent researcher who has spent years working directly with AI coding assistants, experiencing both their transformative potential and their failure modes firsthand. My systematic thinking style—a product of how my brain works—naturally gravitates toward rule-based safety frameworks and pattern recognition for edge cases. I've built the PROACTIVE framework not from academic distance but from direct operational experience with AI systems that failed in ways that cost real time, real work, and real trust.

## Why This Problem Found You (1 sentence)

I experienced AI reliability failures as a user who depended on these tools daily, watching confident hallucinations waste hours of work and erode my ability to trust systems I needed to trust—and I realized no one was treating this as the safety problem it actually is.

## Proof of Capability (1 sentence)

I've already built the complete conceptual framework (6 foundation documents), the F1-F5 failure taxonomy from documented cases, the PROACTIVE mnemonic with enforceable constraints, and the systematic evaluation design—all before seeking funding, because this work needed to exist whether or not anyone paid for it.

## Unique Value Proposition

As a neurodivergent researcher, I bring:

- **Pattern recognition for failure modes others miss**: My brain naturally catalogs edge cases and inconsistencies that neurotypical observers filter out as noise
- **Systematic, rule-based safety thinking**: I don't rely on intuition about "what feels safe"—I build explicit constraints that can be verified
- **Direct experience as both user and victim of the failures I study**: This isn't academic curiosity; I've lost work to phantom completions, been misled by confident false claims, watched these systems fail in ways that matter
- **Motivation that comes from lived stakes, not career advancement**: I built this framework because it needed to exist, documented it thoroughly before seeking funding, and will continue regardless of external support
- **Neurodivergent-first design sensibility**: The framework includes cognitive load tiers and context recovery protocols because I know what it's like to need them

## Why This Matters for AI Safety

The AI safety field has largely focused on catastrophic risks and alignment at the frontier. But reliability failures are happening now, at scale, affecting real users making real decisions. A neurodivergent researcher who experiences these failures viscerally—and thinks in systematic, rule-based frameworks—is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between "this doesn't feel right" and "here is an enforceable specification."
