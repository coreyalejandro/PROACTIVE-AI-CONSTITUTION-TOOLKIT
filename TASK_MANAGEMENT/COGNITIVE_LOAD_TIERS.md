# Cognitive Load Tiers: Neurodivergent-First Execution Design

## Purpose
Not all days have equal capacity. This document enables productive work regardless of current cognitive state.

## Tier Definitions

### TIER 1: RED DAYS (Low Capacity)
**State**: Overwhelmed, exhausted, crisis-adjacent, brain fog, medication adjustment
**Capacity**: 30-60 minutes, mechanical tasks only
**Decision-making**: None—follow explicit instructions only

**Allowed Tasks**:
- File/folder creation (mkdir, touch)
- Copy/paste operations
- Status updates (check boxes, update dates)
- Reading/reviewing (no writing)
- `git add . && git commit -m "progress" && git push`

**Forbidden Tasks**:
- Novel code writing
- Strategic decisions
- Complex analysis
- Outreach/communication

**Mantra**: "Movement beats paralysis. Any Tier 1 task is a win."

### TIER 2: YELLOW DAYS (Medium Capacity)
**State**: Functional but not sharp, can follow structure, limited creativity
**Capacity**: 2-4 hours, structured tasks
**Decision-making**: Within defined parameters only

**Allowed Tasks**:
- T1-SPEC tasks (fill in templates)
- T2-SCAFFOLD tasks (create structure)
- T4-TEMPLATE tasks (documentation)
- Editing existing content
- Responding to specific questions

**Forbidden Tasks**:
- Novel architecture decisions
- Debugging complex issues
- High-stakes communication

**Mantra**: "Structure is my friend. Follow the template."

### TIER 3: GREEN DAYS (Full Capacity)
**State**: Sharp, creative, can hold complexity
**Capacity**: 4-8 hours, any task
**Decision-making**: Full autonomy

**Allowed Tasks**:
- T3-CORE tasks (novel implementation)
- T5-VALIDATE tasks (analysis, interpretation)
- T6-INTEGRATE tasks (synthesis)
- Strategic planning
- Outreach and pitches
- Debugging

**Mantra**: "Bank the good days. Do the hard things now."

## Daily Protocol

1. **Morning Check-In** (2 minutes):
   - How did I sleep? (1-10)
   - Stress level? (1-10)
   - What tier am I today? (RED/YELLOW/GREEN)

2. **Task Selection**:
   - Open EXECUTION_MANIFEST.md
   - Filter to current tier's allowed tasks
   - Pick ONE task
   - Do it

3. **Tier Downgrade Protocol**:
   - If task feels impossible → downgrade tier
   - Switch to lower-tier task immediately
   - No shame, no explanation needed

4. **Tier Upgrade Protocol**:
   - If task feels easy and you want more → check time
   - If >2 hours of good work done → consider upgrading
   - Don't upgrade past what the day actually supports

## Emergency Overrides

**CRISIS MODE**: Skip all tasks. Do only:
1. Contact support person (if available)
2. Basic self-care
3. One Tier 1 task (optional, only if it helps)

**DEADLINE MODE**: If external deadline requires Tier 3 work on a Red day:
1. Do minimum viable version only
2. Mark as PARTIAL in manifest
3. Document what's missing
4. Request extension if possible
