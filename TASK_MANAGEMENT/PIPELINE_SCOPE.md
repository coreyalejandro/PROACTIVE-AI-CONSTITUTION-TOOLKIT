# Pipeline Scope: PROACTIVE Toolkit

## Pipeline B: Ultra-Accelerated (2 Weeks)

**Goal**: Minimum Viable Funding Package
**Total Tasks**: P0 (9) + A01 (6) + A04 (3 partial) = 18 tasks

### Day-by-Day Schedule

| Day | Tasks | Checkpoint |
|-----|-------|------------|
| 1 | P0-01, P0-02, P0-03 | — |
| 2 | P0-04, P0-05 | — |
| 3 | P0-06, P0-07, P0-08 | — |
| 4 | P0-09, A01-T1 | CP0: Foundation complete |
| 5 | A01-T2, A01-T3 (start) | — |
| 6 | A01-T3 (complete) | CP1: Working adapter |
| 7 | A01-T4 | — |
| 8 | A01-T5 (start) | — |
| 9 | A01-T5 (complete), A01-T6 | CP2: Full slice complete |
| 10 | A04-T1, A04-T2, A04-T3 (scaffold) | CP-B: MVFP complete |

### Emergency Ship States

**Day 5 Ship** (if forced):
- Elevator pitch + README
- Adapter 01 scaffold (may be non-functional)
- "Work in progress" framing

**Day 8 Ship** (if forced):
- Working Adapter 01
- Qualitative evidence summary
- Research abstract

**Day 10 Ship** (planned):
- Full Pipeline B deliverables
- Or whatever complete + honest scope statement

## Pipeline A: Accelerated (4 Weeks)

**Goal**: Research-ready toolkit
**Total Tasks**: P0 (9) + A01-A04 (24) = 33 tasks

### Week-by-Week Schedule

| Week | Focus | Checkpoint |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | P0 complete, A01 T1-T3 | CP1 |
| 2 | A01 T4-T6, A02 T1-T3 | CP2 |
| 3 | A02 T4-T6, A03 T1-T6 | CP3 |
| 4 | A04 T1-T6, integration | CP4 |

## Exclusions

**Pipeline B excludes**:
- Adapter 02 (CI Safety Gate)
- Adapter 03 (HELM Safety Profile)
- Adapter 04 T4-T6 (full validation)
- Adversarial testing
- External auditor validation

**Pipeline A includes all above**

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| W&B API changes | Medium | High | Pin versions, abstract interface |
| Validation inconclusive | Medium | High | Pre-registered methodology, honest scope |
| Researcher health disruption | High | Critical | Modular tasks, tier system, checkpoints |
| Funding not secured | High | Critical | Ship at any checkpoint, iterate |

## Post-Completion Impact Path

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 5-6 | Publish framework paper to arXiv |
| 6-8 | Submit to [specific venue] |
| 8+ | Engage target organizations for adoption |
| Month 6 | Measure adoption (GitHub stars, citations, downloads) |
